# Far Out

Welcome to the Far Out web application! This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It utilizes a Rails API and a React frontend. It is an interface for viewing and voting on pictures from the NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day. Votes are persisted to the database and several routes exist to display 2 random pictures, the top 5 pictures, and the most recent picture.

## Installation

- Download or clone this project as well as the [Far Out Backend project](https://github.com/nlewis84/farout-backend)

## Usage

- `cd` into the project directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- This will host the app and open a browser window to display it. If the browser doesn't open, but the server started correctly, you can use the links that appear in the terminal to access the app. They should look something like the following:

`Local:            http://localhost:3000/`

`On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.5:3000/server`
- Ensure that the backend is installed and that the Rails server is running
